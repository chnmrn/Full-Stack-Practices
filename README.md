# Full-Stack Practices

A collection of small full-stack development exercises ranging from basic to more advanced topics.
This repository is intended as a structured space to practice, document, and demonstrate progress across different areas of full-stack development.

## 📌 About This Repository

This project contains a series of practical exercises created as part of my full-stack learning journey. Although I already have academic experience, I decided to revisit from the fundamentals to complex ares and strengthen my understanding from the ground up.

### The goal of this repo is to:
- Practice essential full-stack concepts
- Document the learning process clearly
- Build a portfolio of small, functional projects
- Encourage others to explore, modify, and learn from the code

## 📁 Repository Structure

### Each practice includes:
- Source code (C#)
- A README explaining the logic, steps, and thought process
- Commits that reflect incremental development

More projects will be uploaded over time as I progress through the course and continue practicing.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### You can:
- Explore the code for learning purposes
- Clone the repo and run the projects locally
- Modify the implementations to practice your own approach
- Use the examples as reference for your own learning path

Everyone has their own coding style—feel free to adapt and experiment with any of the practices here.

## 📌 Technologies
- C#
- .NET
- Console applications (for the current practices)

*More technologies will appear as the repository grows*

## 🤝 Contributions

This repository is meant to help anyone who wants to practice.
Feel free to open discussions, suggestions, or improve the code if desired.
